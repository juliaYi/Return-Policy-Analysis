# Return-Policy-Analysis

## Introduction 
> One of my hobbies is looking around retailer stores not only for my future purchase but also for catching up trends. When I buy cloths especially, I tend to look at return policy just in case I might need to return the product next time. Even 1% reduction in returns rate can mean huge savings in annual sales, I became curious in finding the best return policy for online stores and physical stores, respectively.

## Data Overview
- The data cover all transactions made between April 1st, 2013 and March 31st, 2014. 

- The return policy has changed from 90 days to 45 days(stricter) on October 1st, 2013.

- Brand_number =5 : Secondary brand - brick-and-mortar stores 
- Brand_number =3 : Outlet brand - brick-and-mortar stores 
- Brand_number =8 : Sister brand - brick-and-mortar stores 
- Brand_number =2 : Primary brand - brick-and-mortar stores 
- Brand_number =1 : Online stores 

- There are three online channel stores with store numbers 2 (primary brand), 6 (secondary brand), and 10 (sister brand)

- All other store numbers indicate brick-and-mortar stores 

- The return policy for online store 10 and for all sister brand brick-and-mortar stores (stores under Brand_number=8)
has not changed. For those stores, the return policy was a 60 days-return policy before October 1st, 2013, and is still a 60-days return policy.

## Conclusion
> I found that return policy change (stricter) on online store doesn't affect sales or returns amount. On the other hand, sales or return dollar amount decreased around 50% for physical stores. What I found very interesting was that it is recommendable to maintain strict return policy for online retail store. However, if it's for physical stores, it is advisable to remain rather lenient policy even though there is no rules of thumb. After return policy change, sales amount per person might decrease, however, sales items might increase. In other words, people might buy more items but cheaper products.
